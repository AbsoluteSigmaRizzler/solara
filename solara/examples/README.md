# What is solara?



Solara is a production ready way to build webapps from Python using IPywidgets and React-IPywidgets.



## What does solara solve?

Widgetti saves the state at the server, and the client, leading to minimal data traffic, and reloading a page will keep your web app in the same state. If you disconnect for a while, you state will be stored at the server, and will be restored at the next reconnect. You data is never lost.

```python
def foo(bar="lolz"):
    print(bar, 1)
```

```python
def bubble_sort(list)
  return list if list.size <= 1 # already sorted
  swapped = true
  while swapped do
    swapped = false
    0.upto(list.size-2) do |i|
      if list[i] > list[i+1]
        list[i], list[i+1] = list[i+1], list[i] # swap values
        swapped = true
      end
    end
  end

  list
end
```
